incidents and accidents

A man walks 
down the street

<br>
It's a street in 
a strange world                           Maybe it's the Third World 
<br>Maybe it's his
first time aroundHe doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency He is a                   foreign man He is surrounded 
by the sound The sound Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages


He looks around, around
<p>
He sees angels 
in the architecture
<br>
Spinning in infinity
He says 
<br>
Amen!

<br>
Hallelujah!
<br>

<p>
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost 
palI can call you Betty
And Betty when 
you call me
You can call 
me Al
</p>
Call 
me 
Al
