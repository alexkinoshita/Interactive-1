You Can Call Me Al by Paul Simon
</div>

<div class="container">


  <p class="typing">
    A man walks down the street
He says, why am I soft in the middle now
Why am I soft in the middle.
The rest of my life is so hard.
I need a photo-opportunity.
I want a shot at redemption.
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard.
Bonedigger Bonedigger,
Dogs in the moonlight.
Far away my well-lit door,
Mr. Beerbelly Beerbelly.
Get these mutts away from me.
You know I don't find this stuff amusing anymore.If you'll be my bodyguard,
I can be your long lost pal.
I can call you Betty,
And Betty when you call me,
You can call me Al.

 <div class="typing2">
 A man walks down the street
He says why am I short of attention
Got a short little span of attention
And wo my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family
What if I die here
Who'll be my role-model
Now that my role-model is
Gone Gone
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
All along along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al
