A man walks down the street


<br>
<br>

He says why am I soft in the middle now
Why am I soft in the middle
The rest of my life is 
<br>
so hard
<p>
I need a photo-opportunity
<p>
I want a shot at redemption
<p>
Don't want to end up a cartoon. 
In a cartoon graveyard
</p>

<p> 
Dogs in the moonlight 
</p>
Far away my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
<br>
<br>
You know
<p>
I    don't    find    this    stuff    amusing    anymore
<br>
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
<p>
<p>
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
</p>

A man walks down the street
He says 
<p>
why am I short of attention
<p>
Got a short little span of attention
And wo my nights are so long
<br>
<br>
Where's my wife and family
<br>
<br>
<br>
What if I die here
<p>
Who'll be my role-model
Now that my role-model is
<p>
<br>
<br>
Gone Gone
</p>
<p>
</p>
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl<p>
All along along
<br>
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations
<br>
If you'll be my bodyguard,
I can be your long lost pal.
I can call you Betty,

<p>

And Betty when you call me,
You can call me Al.
Call me Al

</p>

A man walks down the street,
It's a street in a strange world.<p>
Maybe it's the Third World.<p>
Maybe it's his first time around.
<br>
He doesn't speak the language,
He holds no currency.
He is a foreign man.
He is surrounded by the sound.
<br>
<p>
The sound
</p>

Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
<p>
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity.
<br>
<br>
He says Amen! and Hallelujah!
<br>
<br>

If you'll be my bodyguard,
I can be your long lost pal.
I can call you Betty,
<p>
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al.
Call me Al.
