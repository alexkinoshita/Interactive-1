<div class="text">
<p>
A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the Third World
<br>
<div class="static"
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
</br>
He is a foreign man
</p>


<div class="relative">
A man walks down the street
He says why am I short of attention
Got a short little span of attention
And wo my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family
What if I die here
