<div class="style-1">
A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the Third World
<br>
<div class="box-row4">
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
</br>
He is a foreign man
<p>
He is surrounded by the sound
The sound

<div class="box-row6">
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
</div>
<div class="style-1">
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says Amen! and Hallelujah!
</p>
</div>
<div class="box-row5">
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
<div class="style-1">
<p>
Call me Al
</p>


<p>
All along along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations
<p>
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
</p>
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al

A man walks down the street

Maybe it's his first time around
