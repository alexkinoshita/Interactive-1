<p class="center" id="underline"> 
Why am I soft in the middle
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

Bone diggerDogs in the moonlight

<p class="center" id="underline"> 
Far away my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know I don't find this stuff amusing anymore
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al

A man walks down the street
He says why am I short of attention
Got a short little span of attention
And wo my nights are so long
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p class="center" id="navy-boldbig"> 
Where's my wife and family
What if I die here
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p class="center" id="underline"> 
Who'll be my role-model
Now that my role-model is
Gone Gone
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
All along along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al
A man walks down the street
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p class="center" id="navy-boldbig"> 
It's a street in a strange world
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p class="center" id="underline"> 
Maybe it's the Third World
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound
The sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>

<p class="center" id="navy-boldbig"> 
He sees angels in the architecture
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<p class="center" id="underline"> 
Spinning in infinity
He says Amen! and Hallelujah!

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al </p>
