	Emily Oberman is an American designer, originally hailing from Yonkers, New York. She went to college at Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. Shortly upon graduating, was brought under the wing of Tibor Kalman and began working at his studio, M and Co. One of her first major projects included The Talking Heads music video, ‘Nothing But Flowers.’ It is her unique and humorous design technique that spans across identity, motion graphics, publications, packaging, advertising, and film and television. She is intelligent, savvy, creative and contemporary. Oberman has influenced every corner of the media in one way or another. 
	At the age of 30, Oberman founded the small boutique style studio, Number Seventeen with her best friend Bonnie Siegler. Their clients included, NBC Universal—the logos for 30 Rock, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and SNL, Air America, Jane Magazine, Lucky Magazine, Sex and the City, and many more. She has been recognized by the AIGA, The Type Directors Club, and the Art Directors Club (Pentagram). Most recently, Oberman made partner at the legendary design studio, Pentagram. She is the most recently inducted partner to join. Emily Oberman and Alison Castle recently collaborated to compile a book all about Saturday Night live. It is a work of art that embodies the essence and humor of the show. The book is a perfect example of the multi disciplinary nature of Oberman’s work and skill set.
