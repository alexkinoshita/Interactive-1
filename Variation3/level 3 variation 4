A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the Third World
<br>
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
</br>
He is a foreign man
<p>
He is surrounded by the sound
The sound
<br>
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
<
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says Amen! and Hallelujah!
</p>

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
<p>
Call me Al

All along along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations
<p>
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
</p>
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al
